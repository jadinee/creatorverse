# WEB103 Prework - *Creatorverse*

Submitted by: **Jadine Delfin-Watanabe**

About this web app: **I built Creatorverse to share some of my favorite content creators and practice using React with Supabase. The app lets me add, edit, view, and delete creators, and it shows a little bit about the different interests I follow.**

Time spent: **9** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **A logical component structure in React is used to create the frontend of the app**
- [x] **At least five content creators are displayed on the homepage of the app**
- [x] **Each content creator item includes their name, a link to their channel/page, and a short description of their content**
- [x] **API calls use the async/await design pattern via Axios or fetch()**
- [x] **Clicking on a content creator item takes the user to their details page, which includes their name, url, and description**
- [x] **Each content creator has their own unique URL**
- [x] **The user can edit a content creator to change their name, url, or description**
- [x] **The user can delete a content creator**
- [x] **The user can add a new content creator by entering a name, url, or description and then it is displayed on the homepage**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Picocss is used to style HTML elements
- [x] The content creator items are displayed in a creative format, like cards instead of a list

## Notes

I used GitHub Copilot AI to help me debug and troubleshoot some error messages I didnâ€™t understand. Working on this project also gave me a chance to review aspects of React and JavaScript. I also got to practice connecting everything with Supabase and managing my code with GitHub.
